# Functional Test Examples

Functional tests exercise complete business flows through the real application code.
Third-party services are NOT mocked unless the user explicitly requests it.
Every test must include a business-language docstring.

## Example: Order placement flow

```python
# tests/functional/test_order_flow.py
import pytest
from myapp.use_cases import place_order, cancel_order
from myapp.models import Order, Product, Customer

    and a product with 5 units available in stock,
    When the customer places an order for 2 units,
    Then the order is confirmed, the product stock decreases to 3,
    and the customer's order history includes the new order.
